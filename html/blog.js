            <h2>Budgeting and Financial Planning</h2>
            <p>Before you start house hunting, it's crucial to determine your budget. Consider the following:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Home loan eligibility and EMI capacity</li>
                <li>Additional costs like stamp duty, registration, GST, and maintenance</li>
                <li>Future expenses and financial goals</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Location Selection</h2>
            <p>Mumbai's vast expanse offers diverse neighborhoods with varying price points. Consider these factors when choosing a location:</p>

            <h2>Property Type and Size</h2>
            <p>Based on your budget and requirements, decide on the type of property (apartment, villa, plot) and the size that suits your needs. Remember to consider future needs if you're planning to stay long-term.</p>
            
            <h2>Legal Checks</h2>
            <p>Ensure the property has clear titles and all necessary approvals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify the builder's credentials and project approvals</li>
                <li>Check for encumbrances and liens</li>
                <li>Ensure the property has an Occupation Certificate (for ready-to-move properties)</li>
                <li>Verify RERA registration (for under-construction properties)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Home Loan Process</h2>
            <p>If you're planning to take a home loan, compare offers from different banks and financial institutions. Consider factors like interest rates, processing fees, and prepayment options.</p>
            
            <h2>Negotiation and Purchase</h2>
            <p>Once you've found the right property, negotiate the price and terms. Ensure all agreements are in writing and reviewed by a legal expert before signing.</p>
            
            <h2>Post-Purchase Steps</h2>
            <p>After purchasing, complete the registration process, pay stamp duty, and ensure all utilities are transferred to your name.</p>
            
            <p>Buying a home is a significant financial and emotional investment. Take your time, do thorough research, and seek professional advice when needed to make an informed decision.</p>
